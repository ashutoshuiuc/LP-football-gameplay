This is the repository for our project "Linear Programmming based Football Gameplay" completed with Satdhruti Paul, Ayush Singh and Karshik Madavi.
The full report for the project can be found in ```ME308___Next_Best_Move.pdf```.
We formulated the Optimization Problem by crafting a custom scoring function for each player position in the field and designed constraints and Objective Functions for optimal gameplay using
our understanding of the game. We integrated various game strategies implemented the LP problem in PuLP and visualized the gameplay from random initializations using matplotlib. The gameplay can
be visualized by running ```main_visual.py```.
